Hi there! I am Francesco Montagna, starting from Janaury 2022 I am going to be an ELLIS doctoral student jointly between [MalGa](https://ml.unige.it/) and [Amazon AWS](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazons-fourth-r-d-center-in-germany-is-dedicated-to-open-ai-research), supervised by [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/), [Nicoletta Noceti](https://www.dibris.unige.it/noceti-nicoletta) and [Francesco Locatello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wQanfTIAAAAJ&hl=en).
The focus of my PhD is to learn representation carrying information about the causal structure in the data, in order to build more sustainable and generalizable machine learning algorithms. <br/>
During my B.Sc. I graduated in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, where I also got my M.Sc. degree in Data Science and Engineering. I've also been a member of [MALTO](https://malto.netlify.app/), the machine learning team of our university.

I am asystematically and broadly interested in neuroscience, philosophy, blockchain development, math and art. Please feel free to contact me to chat about any of these topics! I am more than glad to exchange opinions and ideas.
