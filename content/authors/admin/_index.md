I am Francesco Montagna, PhD student at [MaLGa](https://ml.unige.it/) supervised by [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/), [Nicoletta Noceti](https://rubrica.unige.it/personale/UkNGWV9h) and [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/). Previously, I was an intern at Amazon AWS in Tubingen, Germany.
I focus my work on Causal Representation Learning and Causal Discovery. 
During my B.Sc. I graduated in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, where I also obtained my M.Sc. degree in Data Science and Engineering.
