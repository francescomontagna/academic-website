I am Francesco Montagna, I am en ELLIS PhD student at [MaLGa](https://ml.unige.it/) supervised by [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/) and [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/). Previously, I was an intern at Amazon AWS in Tubingen, Germany. Currently, I am visting researcher at the [CLeaR](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/causality/) group at Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by professor [Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/)
My research is focused on causal discovery and causal representation learning in the i.i.d. setting.
