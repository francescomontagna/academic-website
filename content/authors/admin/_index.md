Hi there! I am Francesco Montagna, ELLIS PhD student at [MaLGa](https://ml.unige.it/) and [Amazon AWS](https://www.amazon.science/latest-news/amazons-fourth-r-d-center-in-germany-is-dedicated-to-open-ai-research), supervised by [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/), [Nicoletta Noceti](https://rubrica.unige.it/personale/UkNGWV9h) and [Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com/).
I focus my work on Causal Representation Learning and Causal Discovery. 
During my B.Sc. I graduated in Physics Engineering at Politecnico di Torino, where I also got my M.Sc. degree in Data Science and Engineering. During this time I have been a member of [MALTO](https://malto.netlify.app/), the machine learning team of the university.

Please feel free to contact me to chat about causality or any topic! I am more than glad to exchange opinions and ideas. Also drop an email if you are willing to discuss a project.
