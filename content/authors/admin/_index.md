Hi there! I am Francesco Montagna, I am a research scientist in applied AI at [LINKS Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/) in Turin.

My interests span from research in theoretical machine learning to its real world applications. I am interested in a research career in Neuroscience, epsecially about its interplay with artificial intelligence. I am also a former member of [MALTO](https://malto.netlify.app/), Machine Learning at PoliTo team.
